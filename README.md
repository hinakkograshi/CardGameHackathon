#### MeltingHack Sprint #2 - Team Swift Submission

### Inspiration
Given the hackathon theme of making a card game, we decided to do our own implementation of [High Stakes](https://krystman.itch.io/high-stakes), a simple probability puzzle game. The original game only has a version built for web and given the form factor and the quick playability of the game, creating a version for the phone was natural. 

### Gameplay
In Jo-ka?, there are 8 number cards, 2 - 9, and 1 joker with a value of 10. The objective is to flip over as many cards as possible without flipping the joker. As you flip over columns of the board, you get access to hints which provide additional information on unknown cards. The minimum hint reveals the minimum value a chosen unknown card can be. The comparison hint reveals whether adjecent cards are greater than a chosen known card. The glass hint reveals the value of a card. Flip over cards while avoiding the joker to get the highest score possible!

### Future Features
- A stake to immediately guess the joker
- Increasing difficulty between rounds
- Hints for rows
- Online leaderboards
